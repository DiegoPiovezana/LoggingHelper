            <summary>
            Minimum level to be logged in the log file.

            <summary>
            Dictionary of log levels.
            TRACE - Used only for tracing the code and trying to find a specific part of a function.
            DEBUG - Information useful for diagnosis.
            INFO - Information generally useful for logging (start/stop of a service, configuration assumptions, etc.). Information I want to have available, but don't typically care about under normal circumstances.
            WARNING - Anything that may cause strange behavior in the application, but for which I am automatically recovering.
            ERROR - Any error that is fatal to the operation but not the service or application (cannot open a needed file, missing data, etc.). These errors will force user (administrator or direct user) intervention. They are usually reserved for incorrect connection strings, missing services, etc.
            CRITICAL - Any error that is forcing a shutdown of the service or application to prevent further data loss (or further significant data loss). Typically used only for the most heinous errors and situations where there is guaranteed to have been an error that has caused some data corruption or loss.

            <summary>
            Checks if the log file is older than a specified number of days and deletes it if necessary. It also checks if the directory is valid and creates it if it doesn't exist.

            <param name="days">The number of days after which the log file should be considered outdated. Default is 3 days.</param>
